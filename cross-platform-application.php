	      <p>Cross-Platform mobile apps are apps that are compatible with and can run on any mobile platform. As market demands and user needs are growing, you need to make sure you are available everywhere at the right time. Cross-Platform applications help your business to be available in the right market at the right time.
Cross-Platform apps need to be carefully designed and developed because they are intended for use in multiple platforms. Every update in version of the platform also requires an update to be made in your app, as well. So maintenance is a huge task in itself. So when a feasibility study is done, first you need to evaluate whether this app is to be developed as a cross-platform app in the first place.</p>
<p>Various platforms are available for developing Cross-Platform apps. However, PhoneGap is the most sought after framework for building hybrid apps as it is open-source.
PhoneGap framework can help build mobile apps that will work in various platforms including iOS, Android, BlackBerry, Symbian and Windows Phone. The cross platform applications are based on common languages for scripting, using CSS, HTML and Java Script.
</p>

	                    <h4> Cross Platform Applications
</h4>
<p>Cross-platform applications are a popular choice for clients as they offer the chance to develop an app for both iOS and Android at a reduced cost.</p>

<p>For certain projects, with the correct use case this may be true. However, there are sometimes pitfalls along the way that can negate some of the upfront cost benefits.</p>

Android and iOS SDKs have tools in place that make diagnosing native app issues easier. With mobile web there is a lack of support in comparison and it can be more time consuming when trying to diagnose performance issues. </p></Div>
