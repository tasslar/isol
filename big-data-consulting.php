<p> The problem was that the database technology simply couldn't handle multiple, continuous streams of data. It couldn't handle the volume of data. It couldn't modify the incoming data in real-time. And reporting tools were lacking that couldn't handle anything but a relational query on the back-end. Big Data solutions offer cloud hosting, highly indexed and optimized data structures, automatic archival and extraction capabilities, and reporting interfaces have been designed to provide more accurate analyses that enable businesses to make better decisions.
</p>
<p>Better business decisions means that companies can reduce the risk of their decisions, and make better decisions that reduce costs and increase marketing and sales effectiveness.
</p>

<p>Using data to generate business value is already a reality in many industries. With the advent of the "Internet of things," improved analytics and increased connectivity through new technology and software bring significant opportunities for companies. For example, at Siemens, this is transforming the way maintenance services are delivered, from reactive approaches to predictive and preventive maintenance.</p>

<p>But we do see companies facing challenges in leveraging the value that data have to offer. 				</p>
